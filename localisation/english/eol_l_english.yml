 eolbioengfac.4.desc:0 "Welcome to the Space Amoeba Division of the BEF.\n\nThe §YSpace Amoebas§! - the name has stuck as the pronunciation of the proper xeno-taxonomic denominator is too unwieldy for the average citizen - are solitary animals, when left to their own devices. All but the youngest specimens are accompanied by quasi-independent flagella, organisms spawned by the Amoeba and programmed through liquid, RNA-laced secretions to do the bidding of the host. These flagella are capable of manipulating and even attacking objects in an impressive yet restricted range around the host, periodically returning to lodge inside the host Amoeba's body for re-programming.\n\nThere are potential military applications to be found in the regenerative properties of the amoeba's thick hide, or in the flagella's graceful patterns of movement but we can also breed some as reinforcements for our fleets."

 eolbioengfac.5.desc:0 "Welcome to the Tiyanki Division of the BEF.\n\nThe spaceborne lifeforms - which we call "§YTiyanki§!" - are docile creatures. Capable of accessing some lower dimension of subspace, in the wild they roam from system to system with remarkable ease.\n\nThey graze on gases common to the upper layers of many gas giants. It is highly unlikely, to say the least, that this is their only food source, but intake of other nutrients has yet to be observed.\n\nTheir wild versions will not attack unless provoked. They can safely be ignored.\n\nOur combat breed Tiyankis will support our fleets with strong auras."

They are solitary beings, each individual Crystal Sovereign rarely seen with more than a Sentinel and a smaller Cohort entity. Aside from the Cohort and Sentinel clearly being subservient to the Sovereign of the group, the subtle nuances of the Crystalline Entities' socio-hierarchical relationships are lost on us.\n\nThe Entities do not seem to mate, and we have yet to observe any Crystals in the wild that are recognizably older or younger than others. Contrary to an early hypothesis, the shifts in hue between individual Crystalline Entities seem to be related not to their age but to their latent internal charge - which can be violently unleashed and are a powerful weapon - and it appear as if though sporadic fluctuations in this charge alter the refractive properties of the Crystal."

They seem to have originated just a scant few billion years after matter as we know it first appeared, the tremendous forces of the young cosmos making something out of nothing. They would have been stars once, but were not.\n\nExplaining their apparent animal intelligence is more difficult, but the answer might lie in the abnormally strong electromagnetic fields that keep them together - another product of their primordial beginnings. It is not inconceivable that, given enough time, the circulation of its strange stardust and gravitic fields aligned in a flexible approximation of neural pathways.\n\nMoreover, the Clouds seem to be receiving impulses from one another, if not outright communicating, lightyears apart. Quantum entanglement is suspected to play a role in this phenomenon.\n\nVoid Clouds are strong opponents and would make a formidable addition to our fleets"

What we are seeing is but a small part of a greater whole - the creature in its entirety is multitudes larger.\n\nIt is very fortunate that it was unable to complete its transition into our universe. Had it been successful, the creature would likely have consumed all life in the galaxy by now.\n\nAfter years of research we are now able to safely summon more specimen of this creature. Due to its nature it can't travel hyperlanes but it could use the gateway network and wormholes to travel and help us defend our territory."

The accounts we have collected are few and sparse with intel. Few sources even have firsthand experience with the thing.\n\nAll our data points to the same fact, however: it is a terror that brings nothing but ruin.\n\nThe Stellar Devourer is capable of feeding off of fusion itself. Our very educated guess is that its biology is the result of some outer-dimensional fusing of dark matter and solar matter. It dives into stars, feasting on their innards in order to fuel its own, internal fusion reactor. It brings death to all systems it reaches. Either they shatter like ice after its banquet, or they burn from being exposed to a second sun from within the being's belly.\n\nIt wants to feed, and it will stop at nothing to get its share.

 # Startscreen Texts
 START_SCREEN_CREATORS:0 "Long ago, in ancient times, our ancestors were the very first to set out to explore the galaxy. But to their disappointment, they found nothing. Everywhere only empty, dead worlds devoid from any life.\n\nAfter they explored every inch and found all of the secrets the galaxy had to offer, they asked themselves: What now?\n\nWithout a task, without a goal, life seemed pointless. This was the point at which our ancestors made a decision that would change the galaxy for all time. They started planting new life planet by planet and thus became the creators of countless civilizations.\n\nFor thousands of years they just watched as their creations were growing and learning, sometimes guiding them in times of need or protecting them from outside harm.\n\nBut one day an unknown threat arrived from outside of the galaxy, invading their childrens homeworlds, murdering them and burning down what they had build. Our Ancestors fought hard against this threat but could not stop it. In an last attempt they sacrificed their great empire to defeat the invaders so that their children could live on. The once so great creators vanished... but some of our kind survived in cryostasis for billions of year. Now is the time to awaken and rebuild our legacy to protect and guide those who we once created."
