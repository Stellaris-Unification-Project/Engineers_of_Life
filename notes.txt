Comment by Spider:
"I actually did have a few. One would be event chains based on your primary ethic when seeding a new planet. For example, Spiritualists could see to it that the primitive species they created shares their faith, while Materialists could intentionally seed a planet with a species that has low habitability for that planet class just to see if they can evolve. Xenophiles can create species that will eventually have the 'Life-Seeded' origin if they become a full-fledged spacefaring civilization, while Xenophobes could intentionally put a species on a hellish planet just for their own amusement. Authoritarians and Egalitarians would mostly be interested in ensuring that the species doesn't develop the 'wrong' beliefs. Gestalts... not sure, honestly.

I did have another crazy idea, but it's kind of beyond the scope of a mod like this and would involve compatibility with other mods."
